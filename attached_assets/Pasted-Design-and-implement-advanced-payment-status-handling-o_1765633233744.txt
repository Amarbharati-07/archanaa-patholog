Design and implement advanced payment status handling on the existing pathology lab website without changing any current UI or layout. Whenever a user completes a booking and makes a payment, the user dashboard must clearly display the payment status in a professional manner, showing whether the payment is completed, pending verification, or set as cash on delivery. If the user pays using online methods such as UPI, debit card, credit card, net banking, wallet, or bank transfer, the user dashboard should show the status as “Payment Completed – Verification Pending” until the admin verifies it. If the user selects cash on delivery or cash at lab, the dashboard should display “Cash on Delivery” or “Pay at Lab” accordingly. All payment details including payment method, amount paid, transaction or reference ID, date and time of payment, and current verification status must be visible to the user in their dashboard in a clean and professional format. The same complete payment information must also appear on the admin dashboard for each booking, where the admin can review, verify, and mark the payment as completed. Once the admin verifies and completes the payment, the user dashboard must automatically update the payment status to “Payment Completed” without requiring the user to refresh or log in again. Diagnostic reports generated by the admin must remain hidden from the user until the payment status is marked as completed by the admin. If the user attempts to view or download a report before payment completion, a popup message should appear stating “Your payment is not completed yet. Please complete or wait for verification to access the report.” After admin verification, the report should instantly become visible and downloadable on the user dashboard. All payment statuses, verification actions, booking updates, and report access permissions must stay fully synchronized in real time between the admin panel and the user dashboard while using the existing booking and report workflow.
