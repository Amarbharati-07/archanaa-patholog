The website UI and database are already implemented, but there is a functional bug in the booking and payment flow that needs to be fixed and enhanced without changing the existing layout. Currently, when a user clicks the Confirm Booking button, the booking is created directly without showing any payment method selection, which is incorrect. This flow must be corrected so that clicking the Confirm Booking button first opens a payment method selection step before finalizing the booking. The user must be required to choose a payment method such as UPI, debit card, credit card, net banking, bank transfer, wallet, cash on delivery, or pay at lab, and only after selecting a payment method should the booking be confirmed. The selected payment method, payment amount, test name, booking ID, patient ID, and payment status must be saved correctly and displayed on both the user dashboard and the admin dashboard. On the user dashboard, each booking must clearly show which payment method was selected, whether the payment is completed, pending verification, cash on delivery, or pay at lab, and the total amount paid or due. On the admin dashboard, each booking must clearly display full payment information including the test name, payment method used by the user, amount paid, transaction or reference ID if applicable, and current payment status. Add a clear “Verify Payment” or “Mark Payment as Verified” action button on the admin dashboard so that the admin can manually confirm that the payment has been received. Until the admin verifies the payment, the payment status should remain pending or unverified on both dashboards. Once the admin clicks the verify payment button, the payment status should update to verified and completed in real time for both the user and the admin. Diagnostic reports generated by the admin must only become visible and downloadable to the user after the payment is verified by the admin. If the user clicks on download report before payment verification, a popup message must appear saying “Your payment is not verified yet. Please wait for admin confirmation to download the report.” After payment verification, the report should automatically unlock and become downloadable without page refresh or re-login. Fix the booking flow so that payment selection is mandatory, payment data is never missing, and all booking, payment, verification, and report access states remain fully synchronized between the user dashboard and the admin dashboard using the existing backend and database structure.
